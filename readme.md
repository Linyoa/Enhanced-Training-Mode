When Super Smash Brother’s Ultimate was announced, we all had rather high hopes for the game. In a lot of ways, those hopes were met (Everyone is here!), but one way they certainly weren’t met is its training mode. That’s not to say it’s not an improvement over past games, in a lot of ways it is, just that it still leaves something to be desired. A lot to be desired. That’s where the Enhanced Training Adapter comes in.
The adapter was born as a way to allow users to lab combos with multiple DI, SDI, and escape options. From there, more and more features were added, and I’m got plans for plenty of new stuff in the future too.

# Requirements
	While the adapter is plug and play, it does have a few requirements: Namely, a GameCube controller, as well as either an official Switch/Wii U adapter or a Mayflash adapter. Note that while the adapter supports the Gamecube or Wii, and will mostly work fine for older smash games, it is designed with Ultimate in mind. Please also note that if a Mayflash adapter is used, it must be updated to the latest firmware. Additionally, the control scheme used for the training adapter should be default controls with rumble turned ON. 

# Getting Started
	Setting up your Enhanced Training Adapter could not be simpler. Simply plug a second Gamecube Controller into the female port on the training adapter, and plug the training adapter into the console the same way you would a normal GameCube controller. After that, plug the controller that you’re going to play on into the console, and you’re good to go!

Please note that the training adapter is meant to be used on a second controller, controlling a second player, NOT the controller you yourself are going to be using. It can be used in training mode or in regular battles, but if used in training mode, please set the CPU to “control”.

# Modes
	Different training mod options are cycled via the D-pad. By default, all training modes are off. Press the D-pad option of your choice to cycle to the next option on the list. Note that the DI and Escape options (except Up-B OOS) won’t start until you hit the training CPU, because they’re triggered by rumble.

- DI Modes (D-Pad Left)
	- Random Left / Right DI - Switches between full left and full right DI every frame.
	- True Random DI - DI in an entirely new and random direction every frame.
	- Set DI - DI in the direction the stick was held in when this mode was enabled.
	- Random SDI - The CPU will pick one of the 4 cardinal directions and max speed SDI in that direction. Press start to reset SDI, and the CPU will pick a new direction the next time it is hit.
	- Set SDI - The CPU will max speed SDI in the direction the stick was held when this mode was enabled.

- Escape Modes (D-Pad Right)
	- Airdodge - Airdodges every other frame.
	- Jump - Jumps every other frame.
	- Down-B - The CPU will use down special every other frame. Useful when combined with down special like rest or pokemon change.
	- Up-B OOS - The CPU will hold shield. After a hit connects on shield, the CPU will immediately Up-B out of shield.

- Input Recording - Press D-Pad down to start recording inputs (for up to 400 frames. Press D-pad down again to stop recording inputs.
- Input Playback - Press D-Pad Up to start playing recorded inputs. Input loops on completion.

# Updating
You can always find the most recent version of the Enhanced Training Mod hex on my twitter (@Linyoa) or on my GitHub (Github.com/Linyoa). Once you’ve downloaded the hex file, you can load it onto your adapter with a tool like Xloader (http://xloader.russemotto.com/). Simply open Xloader, select the hex file you downloaded,  and then select Duemilanove/Nano(ATmega328) as the device, and make sure you're using the correct COM port (it should be the one that shows up when you plug your board's USB cable in). Leave all other options default, then press upload.
